# ClassicRLAlgorithms
Open source implementation of classic RL algorithms from scratch. Mainly for learning purpose and practice Test Driven Development (TDD).
In this repo, I try to implement classic algorithms presented in David Silver's RL lecture series, which could be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0&list=PLqYmG7hTraZDM-OYHWgPebj2MfCFzFObQ


## Algorithms implemented ##
Lecture 3: Dynamic Programming
1. Value Iteration for estimating the value function
You can try the grid world example by running the tryoutVi.py file
2. Policy Iteration for control problem
